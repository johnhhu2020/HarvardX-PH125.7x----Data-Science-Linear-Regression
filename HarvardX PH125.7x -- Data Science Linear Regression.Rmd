# Motivating Example: Moneyball

As motivation for this course, we'll go back to 2002 and try to build a baseball team with a limited budget.  Note that in 2002, the Yankees payroll was almost $130 million, and had more than tripled the Oakland A's $40 million budget.  [][Statistics have been used in baseball since its beginnings].  Note that the data set we will be using, included in the Lahman Library, goes back to the 19th century.  For example, a summary of statistics we will describe soon, the **batting average**, has been used to summarize a batter's success for decades.  Other statistics such as home runs, runs batted in, and stolen bases, we'll describe all this soon, are reported for each player in the game summaries included in the sports section of newspapers.  

And players are rewarded for high numbers.  Although summary statistics were widely used in baseball, data analysis per se was not.  These statistics were arbitrarily decided on without much thought as to whether they actually predicted, or were related to helping a team win.  This all changed with Bill James.  In the late 1970s, this aspiring writer and baseball fan started publishing articles describing more in-depth analysis of baseball data.  He named the approach of using data to predict what outcomes best predict if a team wins [][sabermetrics].  Until Billy Beane made sabermetrics the center of his baseball operations, Bill James' work was mostly ignored by the baseball world.  

Today, pretty much every team uses the approach, and it has gone beyond baseball into other sports.  In this course, to simplify the example we use, **we'll focus on predicting scoring runs.  We will ignore pitching and fielding**, although those are important as well.  We will see how regression analysis can help develop strategies to build a competitive baseball team with a constrained budget.  [][The approach can be divided into two separate data analyses.  In the first, we determine which recorded player specific statistics predict runs.  In the second, we examine if players were undervalued based on what our first analysis predicts.]

# Baseball Basics

We actually don't need to understand all the details about the game of baseball, which has over 100 rules, to see how regression will help us find undervalued players.  Here, we distill the sport to the basic knowledge one needs to know to effectively attack the data science challenge.  Let's get started.
[][The goal of a baseball game is to score more runs, they're like points, than the other team].  Each team has _nine batters_ that bat in a predetermined order.  After the ninth batter hits, we start with the first again.  Each time they come to bat, we call it a _plate appearance, PA_.  At each plate appearance, the _other team's pitcher_ throws the ball and you try to hit it.  The plate appearance ends with a binary outcome--you either make an _out_, that's a failure and sit back down, or you don't, that's a success and you get to _run around the bases and potentially score a run_ (`  So a run means batter from Home base to 2ed base or something??? `).  Each team gets nine tries, referred to as innings, to score runs.  Each inning ends after three outs, after you've failed three times.  

From these examples, we see how luck is involved in the process.  When you bat you want to hit the ball hard.  If you hit it hard enough, it's a home run, the best possible outcome as you get at least one automatic run.  But sometimes, due to chance, you hit the ball very hard and a defender (`  who is this defender???  `) catches it, which makes it an out, a failure.  In contrast, sometimes you hit the ball softly but it lands just in the right place.  You get a hit which is a success.  The fact that there is chance involved hints at why probability models will be involved in all this.  Now there are [][several ways to succeed].  **Understanding this distinction will be important for our analysis**.  

[][When you hit the ball you want to pass as many bases as possible].  There are four bases with the fourth one called home plate.  Home plate is where you start, where you try to hit.  So the bases form a cycle.  [][If you get home, you score a run] (`  does this means you passes 4 bases one by one under one batter???  `).  We're simplifying a bit.  But there are **five ways you can succeed**.  In other words, not making an out.  First one is called a **base on balls**.  [][This is when the pitcher does not pitch well and you get to go to first base].  A single is when you hit the ball and you get to first base.  A double is when you hit the ball and you go past first base to second.  **Triple** is when you do that but get to third.  And [][a home run is when you hit the ball and go all the way home and score a run].  [][If you get to a base, you still have a chance of getting home and scoring a run if the next batter hits successfully].  While you are on base, you can also try to [][steal a base].  If you run fast enough, you can try to go from first to second or from second to third without the other team tagging you. 

All right.  Now historically, the **batting average** has been considered the most important offensive statistic.  To define this average, we define a [][hit] and an [][at bat].  **Singles, doubles, triples, and home runs are **[][hits].  But remember, there's a fifth way to be successful, the **base on balls**.  That is not a hit.  [][An at bat] **is the number of times you either get a hit or make an out**, bases on balls are excluded.  The batting average is simply hits divided by at bats.  And it is considered the main measure of a success rate.  Today, in today's game, this success rates ranges from player to player from about 20% to 38%.  We refer to the batting average in thousands.  So for example, if your success rate is 25% we say you're batting 250.  

One of Bill James' first important insights is that the [][batting average ignores bases on balls but bases on balls is a success].  So a player that gets many more bases on balls than the average player might not be recognized if he does not excel in batting average.  But is this player not helping produce runs?  No award is given to the player with the most bases on balls.  In contrast, the total number of stolen bases are considered important and an award is given out to the player with the most.  But players with high totals of stolen bases also make outs as they do not always succeed.  

So does a player with a high stolen base total help produce runs?  Can we use data size to determine if it's better to pay for bases on balls or stolen bases?  [][One of the challenges in this analysis is that it is not obvious how to determine if a player produces runs because so much depends on his teammates].  We do keep track of the number of runs scored by our player.  **But note that if you hit after someone who hits many home runs**, you will score many runs (`  Super batter hit the ball far away thus you can run many bases as well, lucky player  `).  But these runs don't necessarily happen if we hire this player but not his home run hitting teammate.  [][However, we can examine team level statistics] (`  How ???  `).  How do teams with many stolen bases compare to teams with few?  How about bases on balls?  We have data.  Let's examine some.

[][Key points]

    The goal of a baseball game is to score more runs (points) than the other team.
    Each team has 9 batters who have an opportunity to hit a ball with a bat in a predetermined order. 
    Each time a batter has an opportunity to bat, we call it a plate appearance (PA).
    The PA ends with a binary outcome: the batter either makes an out (failure) and returns to the bench or the batter doesn’t (success) and can run around the bases, and potentially score a run (reach all 4 bases).
    We are simplifying a bit, but there are five ways a batter can succeed (not make an out):

        Base on balls (BB): the pitcher fails to throw the ball through a predefined area considered to be hittable (the strike zone), so the batter is permitted to go to first base.
        Single: the batter hits the ball and gets to first base.
        Double (2B): the batter hits the ball and gets to second base.
        Triple (3B): the batter hits the ball and gets to third base.
        Home Run (HR): the batter hits the ball and goes all the way home and scores a run.

    Historically, the batting average has been considered the most important offensive statistic. To define this average, we define a hit (H) and an at bat (AB). Singles, doubles, triples, and home runs are hits. The fifth way to be successful, a walk (BB), is not a hit. An AB is the number of times you either get a hit or make an out; BBs are excluded. The batting average is simply H/AB and is considered the main measure of a success rate.
    Note: The video states that if you hit AFTER someone who hits many home runs, you will score many runs, while the textbook states that if you hit BEFORE someone who hits many home runs, you will score many runs. The textbook wording is accurate.

# Bases on Balls or Stolen Bases?

Let's start looking at some baseball data and try to answer your questions using these data.  First one, do teams that hit more home runs score more runs?  We know what the answer to this will be, but let's look at the data anyways.  We're going to examine data from 1961 to 2001.  We end at 2001 because, remember, we're back in 2002, getting ready to build a team.  

We started in 1961, because that year, the league changed from 154 games to 162 games.  _The visualization of choice when exploring the relationship between two variables like home runs and runs is a scatterplot_ (`  So we can do what we prefer I suppose  `).  The following code shows you how to make that scatterplot.  We start by loading the Lahman library that has all these baseball statistics.  And then we simply make a scatterplot using 2d plot.  Here's a plot of runs per game versus home runs per game.  

The plot shows a very strong association--teams with more home runs tended to score more runs.  Now, let's examine the relationship between stolen bases and wins.  Here are the runs per game plotted against stolen bases per game.  Here, the relationship is not as clear.  Finally, let's examine the relationship between bases on balls and runs.  Here are runs per game versus bases on balls per game.  Although the relationship is not as strong as it was for home runs, we do see a pretty strong relationship here.  

We know that, by definition, home runs cause runs, because when you hit a home run, at least one run will score. [][Need to stufy how baseball rules the scores or runs, is Runs and Scores the same stuff in baseball game ???]  Now it could be that home runs also cause the bases on balls (`  How ???  `  **base on balls. This is when the pitcher does not pitch well and you get to go to first base**).  If you understand the game, you will agree with me that that could be the case.  [][So it might appear that a base on ball is causing runs, when in fact, it's home runs that's causing both].  This is called [][confounding].  An important concept you will learn about.  Linear regression will help us parse all this out and quantify the associations.  This will then help us determine what players to recruit.  Specifically, we will try to predict things like how many more runs will the team score if we increase the number of bases on balls but keep the home runs fixed.  Regression will help us answer this question, as well.

  ggplot(aes(number_of_wins_per_game, fielding_errors_per_game)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.3) 
```
# Explanation

When you examine the scatterplot, you can see a clear trend towards decreased win rate with increasing number of errors per game (`  before I wa using big scatter markersize  `). The following code can be used to make the scatterplot:

```{r}
Teams %>% filter(yearID %in% 1961:2001) %>%
  mutate(win_rate = W / G, E_per_game = E / G) %>%
  ggplot(aes(win_rate, E_per_game)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5)

```



```{r}
Teams %>% summarise(cor(W/G, E/G))
```
# Can we really call this as a relationship ??? Really???   Trying smaller markersize and small alpha


# Question 8

# Correlation


Up to now in this series, we have focused mainly on univariate variables.  However, **in data science application it is very common to be interested in the relationship between two or more variables**. (`Google this topic and explore a case study`)   We saw this in our baseball example in which we were interested in the relationship, for example, between bases on balls and runs.  we'll come back to this example, but we introduce the concepts of correlation and regression using a simpler example.

We'll create a data set with the heights of fathers and the first sons.  The actual data Galton used to discover and define regression.  So we have the father and son height data.  Suppose we were to summarize these data.  **Since both distributions are well approximated by normal distributions, we can use the two averages and two standard deviations as summaries**.  Here they are.

**However, this summary fails to describe a very important characteristic of the data that you can see in this figure.  The trend that the taller the father, the taller the son, is not described by the summary statistics of the average and the standard deviation. We will learn that the correlation coefficient is a summary of this trend**.(`Interesting here how the instructor jumped in the topic of his teaching`)

        Galton tried to predict sons' heights based on fathers' heights.
        The mean and standard errors are insufficient for describing an important characteristic of the data: the trend that the taller the father, the taller the son.
        The correlation coefficient is an informative summary of how two variables move together that can be used to predict one variable using the other.

# Correlation Coefficient


**The correlation coefficient is defined for a list of pairs--x1, y1 through xn, yn**--
with the following formula.  Here, mu x and mu y are the averages of x and y, respectively.
And sigma x and sigma y are the standard deviations.  The Greek letter rho is commonly used in the statistics book, to denote this correlation.  The reason is that rho is the Greek letter for r, the first letter of the word regression.  Soon, we will learn about the connection between correlation and regression.  [][*To understand why this equation does, in fact, summarize how two variables move together*], **consider the i-th entry of x is xi minus mu x divided by sigma x SDs away from the average**.  Similarly, the yi-- which is paired with the xi--is yi minus mu y divided by sigma y SDs away from the average y.  

If x and y are unrelated, then the product of these two quantities will be positive.  That happens when they are both positive or when they are both negative as often as they will be negative.  That happens when one is positive and the other is negative, or the other way around.  One is negative and the other one is positive.  [][*This will average to about 0*.  **The correlation is this average.**]

**And therefore, unrelated variables will have a correlation of about 0** (`  Why ??? Sorry I didn't get it`  ).  If instead the quantities vary together, then we are averaging mostly positive products.  Because they're going to be either positive times positive or negative times negative.  And we get a positive correlation.  If they vary in opposite directions, we get a negative correlation.

Another thing to know is that we can show mathematically that the correlation is always between negative 1 and 1.  To see this, consider that we can have higher correlation than when we compare a list to itself.  That would be perfect correlation.  In this case, the correlation is given by this equation, which we can show is equal to 1.  A similar argument with x and its exact opposite, negative x, proves that the correlation has to be greater or equal to negative 1.  So it's between minus 1 and 1.  

To see what data looks like for other values of rho, here are six examples of pairs with correlations ranging from negative 0.9 to 0.99.  When the correlation is negative, we see that they go in opposite direction.  As x increases, y decreases.  **When the correlation gets either closer to 1 or negative 1, we see the clot of points getting thinner and thinner.  When the correlation is 0, we just see a big circle of points**.

            ((x_i - mu_x)/Sigma_x) * ((y_i - mu_y)/Sigma_y)

# Sample Correlation is a Random Variable


Before we continue describing regression, let's go over a reminder about **random variability**.  In most data science applications, we do not observe the population, but rather a sample.  As with the average and standard deviation, the sample correlation is the most commonly used estimate of the population correlation.  **This implies that the correlation we compute and use as a summary is a random variable** (`  So What ???  `).  As an illustration, let's assume that the 179 pairs of fathers and sons is our entire population.  A less fortunate geneticist can only afford to take a random sample of 25 pairs.  The sample correlation for this random sample can be computed using this code.  **Here, the variable R is the random variable**.  

[][*We can run a monte-carlo simulation to see the distribution of this random variable*].  Here, we recreate R 1000 times, and plot its histogram.  We see that the **expected value is the population correlation**, the mean of these Rs is 0.5, and that it has a relatively high standard error relative to its size, SD 0.147.  This is something to keep in mind when interpreting correlations.  [][**It is a random variable, and it can have a pretty large standard error**].  Also note that **because the sample correlation is an average of independent draws** (` independent? average? how? `), the Central Limit Theorem actually applies.  [][*Therefore, for a large enough sample size N, the distribution of these Rs is approximately normal*].  

The expected value we know is the population correlation.  The standard deviation is somewhat more complex to derive, but this is the actual formula here.  In our example, N equals to 25, does not appear to be large enough to make the approximation a good one (`  how to identify a good one ???  Should the standard deviation equal to a normal distribution or something ???  `), as we see in this QQ-plot.

        The correlation that we compute and use as a summary is a random variable.
        When interpreting correlations, it is important to remember that correlations derived from samples are estimates containing uncertainty.
        Because the sample correlation is an average of independent draws, the central limit theorem applies.

## Course  /  Section 1: Introduction to Regression  /  1.3: Stratification and Variance Explained


# Anscombe's Quartet/Stratification

Correlation is not always a good summary of the relationship between two variables.  A famous example used to illustrate this are the following for artificial data sets, referred to as Anscombe's quartet.  All of these pairs have a correlation of 0.82.  Correlation is only meaningful in a particular context.   To help us understand when it is that correlation is meaningful as a summary statistic, we'll try to predict the son's height using the father's height.  This will help motivate and define linear regression.  **We start by demonstrating how correlation can be useful for prediction**.  

[][*Suppose we are asked to guess the height of a randomly selected son*].  Because of the distribution of the son height is approximately normal, we know that the average height of 70.5 inches is a value with the highest proportion and would be the prediction with the chances of minimizing the error.  [][*But what if we are told that the father is 72 inches?*]  Do we still guess 70.5 inches for the son?  The father is taller than average, specifically he is 1.14 standard deviations taller than the average father.  So shall we predict that the son is also 1.14 standard deviations taller than the average son?  It turns out that this would be an overestimate.  

To see this, we look at all the sons with fathers who are about 72 inches.  We do this by stratifying the father's height.  We call this a **conditional average**, since we are computing the average son height conditioned on the father being 72 inches tall.  A challenge when using this approach in practice is that *we don't have many fathers that are exactly 72*.  In our data set, we only have eight.  If we change the number to 72.5, we would only have one father who is that height.  This would result in averages with large standard errors, and they won't be useful for prediction for this reason.  But for now, what we'll do is we'll take an approach of creating strata of fathers with very similar heights.  Specifically, we will round fathers' heights to the nearest inch.  This gives us the following prediction for the son of a father that is approximately 72 inches tall.  We can use this code and get our answer, which is 71.84.  This is 0.54 standard deviations larger than the average son, a smaller number than the 1.14 standard deviations taller that the father was above the average father.  Stratification followed by _box plots_ lets us see the distribution of each group.  Here is that plot.  

We can see that the centers of these groups are increasing with height, not surprisingly.  *The means of each group appear to follow a linear relationship* (`  then why we supposed to use a scatter plot to explore relationship between two variales in Exploratory Data Analysis in Python DataCamp course ?  I mean many dots covering on each other, Using a boxplot would avoid this condition ???  `).  We can make that plot like this, with this code.  See the plot and notice that this appears to follow a line.  The slope of this line appears to be about 0.5, which happens to be the correlation between father and son heights.  **This is not a coincidence**.  To see this connection, let's plot the **standardized heights** (`  Why??? standardize?  can we just use the boxplot or the grouped mean?  `) against each other, son versus father, with a line that has a slope equal to the correlation.  (` Think, Think, Think `)   [][****Read the important comments in below standardized plot, and think about how its all related to each other****]  

Here's the code.  Here's a plot.  This line is what we call the regression line.  In a later video, we will describe Galton's theoretical justification for using this line to estimate conditional means.  Here, we define it and compute it for the data at hand.  The regression line for two variables, x and y, tells us that [][***for every standard deviation (sigma x) increase above the average (mu x).  For x, y grows rho standard deviations (sigma y) above the average (mu y).***].  The formula for the regression line is therefore this one (`  Think, Think, Think  `)[][How does this comes out???].  If there's perfect correlation, we predict an increase that is the same number of SDs.  If there's zero correlation, then we don't use x at all for the prediction of y.  For values between 0 and 1, the prediction is somewhere in between.  If the correlation is negative, we predict a reduction, instead of an increase.  

***It is because when the correlation is positive but lower than the one, that we predict something closer to the mean (`it has to be the normal distribution, enough sized sample`), that we call this regression.  The son regresses to the average height.***

In fact, the title of Galton's paper was "Regression Towards Mediocrity in Hereditary Stature."  Note that if we write this in the standard form of a line, y equals b plus mx, where b is the intercept and m is the slope, the regression line has slope rho times sigma y, divided by sigma x, and intercept mu y, minus mu x, times the slope.  _So if we standardize the variable so they have average 0 and standard deviation 1.  Then the regression line has intercept 0 and slope equal to the correlation rho_.  Let's look at the original data, father son data, and add the regression line.  We can compute the intercept and the slope using the formulas we just derived.  Here's a code to make the plot with the regression line.  If we plot the data in standard units, then, as we discussed, the regression line as intercept 0 and slope rho.  Here's the code to make that plot.  

We started this discussion by saying that we wanted to use the conditional means to predict the heights of the sons.  But then we realized that there were very few data points in each strata.  When we did this approximation of rounding off the height of the fathers (`  the boxplot  `), we found that these conditional means appear to follow a line.  And we ended up with the regression line (`  that is if we standardize both variables - father, son  `).  ****So the regression line gives us the prediction****.  An advantage of using the regression line is that _we used all the data to estimate just two parameters, the slope and the intercept.  This makes it much more stable_.  When we do _conditional means, we had fewer data points, which made the estimates have a large standard error_, and therefore be unstable.  So this is going to give us a much more stable prediction using the regression line.  However, are we justified in using the regression line to predict?  Galton gives us the answer.

        Correlation is not always a good summary of the relationship between two variables.
        The general idea of conditional expectation is that we stratify a population into groups and compute summaries in each group.
        A practical way to improve the estimates of the conditional expectations is to define strata of with similar values of x.
        If there is perfect correlation, the regression line predicts an increase that is the same number of SDs for both variables. If there is 0 correlation, then we don’t use x at all for the prediction and simply predict the average . For values between 0 and 1, the prediction is somewhere in between. If the correlation is negative, we predict a reduction instead of an increase.

# Bivariate Normal Distribution


**Correlation and the regression line are widely used summary statistics**.  [][*But it is often misused or misinterpreted*].  Anscombe’s example provided toy example of data sets in which summarizing with a correlation would be a mistake.  But we also see it in the media and in scientific literature as well.  

***The main way we motivate the use of correlation involve what is called the bivariate normal distribution***.  [][***When a pair of random variables is approximated by a bivariate normal distribution, the scatterplot looks like ovals, like American footballs***].  They can be thin.  That's when they have high correlation.  All the way up to a circle shape when they have no correlation.  We saw some examples previously.  Here they are again.  A more technical way to define the bivariate normal distribution is the following.  **First, this distribution is defined for pairs** (`  like the father - son paris used earlier  `).  So we have two variables, x and y.  And they have paired values.  They are going to be bivariate normally distributed if the following happens.  

[][*If x is a normally distributed random variable, and y is also a normally distributed random variable--and for any grouping of x that we can define, say, with x being equal to some predetermined value, which we call here in this formula little x--then the y's in that group are approximately normal as well.*]  If this happens, then the pair is approximately bivariate normal.  When we fix x in this way, we then refer to the resulting distribution of the y's in the group--defined by setting x in this way--as the conditional distribution of y given x. (`  Remember we did this before, fix father 72 inches, but the sample size is too small  `)  We write the notation like this for the conditional distribution and the conditional expectation.  If we think the height data is well-approximated by the bivariate normal distribution, then we should see the normal approximation hold for each grouping.  

Here, we stratify the son height by the standardized father heights and see that the assumption appears to hold.  Here's the code that gives us the desired plot.  Now, we come back to defining correlation.  Galton showed-- using mathematical statistics-- that **when two variables follow a bivariate normal distribution, then for any given x the expected value of the y in pairs for which x is set at that value is mu y plus rho x minus mu x divided by sigma x times sigma y**.  Note that this is a line with slope rho times sigma y divided by sigma x and intercept mu y minus n times mu x.  And therefore, this is the same as the regression line we saw in a previous video. (`  Now you must understand the slope difference between standalized vairable and non-standarilized vaiable in father son case we did in prevrious chapter  `)  That can be written like this.  So in summary, if our data is approximately bivariate, then the conditional expectation--which is the best prediction for y given that we know the value of x--is given by the regression line.

[][Key points]

        When a pair of random variables are approximated by the bivariate normal distribution, scatterplots look like ovals. They can be thin (high correlation) or circle-shaped (no correlation).
        When two variables follow a bivariate normal distribution, computing the regression line is equivalent to computing conditional expectations.
        We can obtain a much more stable estimate of the conditional expectation by finding the regression line and using it to make predictions.

# Variance Explained


# Correction (`  So this video is recorded long times ago, how interesting  `)

```The equation shown at 0:10 is for the standard deviation of the conditional distribution, not the variance. **The variance is the standard deviation squared**. See the notes below the video for more clarification.```
![Variance is standard deviation squared](C:/Users/JJ/Pictures/variance and standard deviation.png)
(The theory we've been describing also tells us that the standard deviation of the conditional distribution that we described in a previous video is Var (`  Correction: The equation shown at 0:10 is for the standard deviation of the conditional distribution, not the variance  `) of Y given X equals sigma y times the square root of 1 minus rho squared.  This is where statements like x explains such and such percent of the variation in y comes from.  Note that the variance of y is sigma squared.  That's where we start.  **If we condition on x, then the variance goes down to 1 minus rho squared times sigma squared y**.  So from there, we can compute how much the variance has gone down.  It has gone down by rho squared times 100%.  So the correlation and the amount of variance explained are related to each other.  But it is important to remember that the variance explained statement only makes sense when the data is  by a bivariate normal distribution.

[][Key points]

        Conditioning on a random variable X can help to reduce variance of response variable Y.
        The standard deviation of the conditional distribution is 
        
            SD(Y|X=x) = Sigma_y * SquaredRoot(1 - rho**2), 
        
        which is smaller than the standard deviation without conditioning sigma_y.
        Because variance is the standard deviation squared, the variance of the conditional distribution is:
        
            Var(Y\X=x) = Sigma_y^(2) * (1 - rho**2).
        
        In the statement "X explains such and such percent of the variability," the percent value refers to the variance. The variance decreases by \(\rho^2\) percent.
        The “variance explained” statement only makes sense when the data is approximated by a bivariate normal distribution.

# There are Two Regression Lines


We computed a regression line to predict the son's height from the father's height.  We used these calculations--here's the code--to get the slope and the intercept.  This gives us the function that the conditional expectation of y given x is 35.7 plus 0.5 times x.  So, what if we wanted to predict the father's height based on the son's?  It is important to know that this is not determined by computing the inverse function of what we just saw, which would be this equation here.  [][We need to compute the expected value of x given y].  This gives us another regression function altogether, with slope and intercept computed like this. (`  How did this comes from??  `)  So now we get that the expected value of x given y, or the expected value of the father's height given the son's height, is equal to 34 plus 0.5 y, a different regression line.  

So in summary, it's important to remember that the regression line comes from computing expectations, and these give you two different lines, depending on if you compute the expectation of y given x or x given y.

# Assessment: Stratification and Variance Explained, Part 1

# Question 1

Look at the figure below.
![question one image](C:/Users/JJ/Pictures/7_8_1_assessment_IDS.png)
Scatter plot of son and father heights with son heights on the y-axis and father heights on the x-axis. There is also a regression line that runs from roughly (63,66) to (78,76).  The dots on the plot are scattered around the line.
The slope of the regression line in this figure is equal to what, in words?
**Slope = (correlation coefficient of son and father heights) * (standard deviation of sons’ heights / standard deviation of fathers’ heights)**
Slope = (correlation coefficient of son and father heights) * (standard deviation of fathers’ heights / standard deviation of sons’ heights)
Slope = (correlation coefficient of son and father heights) / (standard deviation of sons’ heights * standard deviation of fathers’ heights)
Slope = (mean height of fathers) - (correlation coefficient of son and father heights * mean height of sons).


#  Question 2
1 point possible (graded)
Why does the regression line simplify to a line with intercept zero and slope rho when we standardize our x and y variables?

Try the simplification on your own first!
When we standardize variables, both x and y will have a mean of one and a standard deviation of zero. When you substitute this into the formula for the regression line, the terms cancel out until we have the following equation: y_i = rho * x_i.
**When we standardize variables, both x and y will have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. When you substitute this into the formula for the regression line, the terms cancel out until we have the following equation: y_i = rho * x_i.**
When we standardize variables, both x and y will have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. When you substitute this into the formula for the regression line, the terms cancel out until we have the following equation: y_i = rho + x_i. 


#  Question 3
1 point possible (graded)
What is a limitation of calculating conditional means?

Select ALL that apply.
**Each stratum we condition on (e.g., a specific father’s height) may not have many data points.**
Because there are limited data points for each stratum, our average values have large standard errors.
**Conditional means are less stable than a regression line.**
Conditional means are a useful theoretical tool but cannot be calculated.


#  Question 4
1/1 point (graded)
**A regression line is the best prediction of Y given we know the value of X when:**
X and Y follow a bivariate normal distribution.
Both X and Y are normally distributed.
Both X and Y have been standardized.
There are at least 25 X-Y pairs.


#  Question 5
0/1 point (graded)
Which one of the following scatterplots depicts an x and y distribution that is NOT well-approximated by the bivariate normal distribution?

I chose 3, but false, why.  

## Explanation

The v-shaped distribution of points from the first plot means that the x and y variables do not follow a bivariate normal distribution.

****When a pair of random variables is approximated by a bivariate normal, the scatter plot looks like an oval**** (as in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th plots) - [][it is okay if the oval is very round (as in the 3rd plot) or long and thin (as in the 4th plot)].

#  Question 6
0/1 point (graded)

We previously calculated that the correlation coefficient between fathers’ and sons’ heights is 0.5.
Given this, what percent of the variation in sons’ heights is explained by fathers’ heights?
0%
25%
**50%**
75%
incorrect  I choose 50% which is incorrect, Think, Think, Think
Answer
Incorrect: Try again. [][When two variables follow a bivariate normal distribution, the variation explained can be calculated as rho^2 x 100](`  How does this comes from???  `).


#  Question 7
1/1 point (graded)

Suppose the correlation between father and son’s height is 0.5, the standard deviation of fathers’ heights is 2 inches, and the standard deviation of sons’ heights is 3 inches.
Given a one inch increase in a father’s height, what is the predicted change in the son’s height?
0.333
0.5
0.667
**0.75**
1
1.5
correct
Answer
Correct: Correct! TThe slope of the regression line is calculated by multiplying the correlation coefficient by the ratio of the standard deviation of son heights and standard deviation of father heights: var_son/var_father.  (Note: here he means SD_son/SD_father, its a mistake)  .

# Confounding: Are BBs More Predictive?


In a previous video, we found that the slope of the regression line for predicting runs from bases on balls was 0.735.  So, **does this mean that if we go and hire low salary players with many bases on balls that increases the number of walks per game by 2 for our team?  Our team will score 1.47 more runs per game?**  [][We are again reminded that association is not causation].  The data does provide strong evidence that a team with 2 more bases on balls per game than the average team scores 1.47 more runs per game, but this does not mean that bases on balls are the cause.  If we do compute the regression line slope for singles, we get 0.449, a lower value.  Note that a single gets you to first base just like a base on balls.  Those that know a little bit more about baseball will tell you that with a single, runners that are on base have a better chance of scoring than with a base on balls (`  DId you see the logic conflict here`).  

So, how can base on balls be more predictive of runs?  The reason this happens is because of [][confounding].  Note the correlation between homeruns, bases on balls, and singles.  We see that the correlation between bases on balls and homeruns is quite high compared to the other two pairs.  [][It turns out that pitchers, afraid of homeruns, will sometimes avoid throwing strikes to homerun hitters].  As a result, homerun hitters tend to have more bases on balls.  Thus, a team with many homeruns will also have more bases on balls than average, and as a result, it may appear that bases on balls cause runs.  But it is actually the homeruns that caused the runs.  

In this case, we say that bases on balls are confounded with homeruns.  [][But could it be that bases on balls still help?  To find out, we somehow have to adjust for the homerun effect.  Regression can help with this].  **=============================================================================================================================**

# Stratification and Multivariate Regression

**To try to determine if bases on balls is still useful for creating runs, a first approach is to keep home runs fixed at a certain value and then examine the relationship between runs and bases on balls**.  As we did when we stratified fathers by rounding to the closest inch, here, we can stratify home runs per game to the closest 10th.  [][We filtered our strata with few points.  We use this code to generate an informative data set.  And then, we can make a scatter plot for each strata].  A scatterplot of **runs** versus **bases on balls**.  This is what it looks like.  Remember that the regression slope for predicting runs with bases on balls when we ignore home runs was 0.735.  

[][**But once we stratify by home runs, these slopes are substantially reduced**].  We can actually see what the slopes are by using this code.  We stratify by home run and then compute the slope using the formula that we showed you previously.  These values are closer to the slope we obtained from singles, which is 0.449.  Which is more consistent with our intuition.  **Since both singles and bases on ball get us to first base, they should have about the same predictive power**.  

Now, although our understanding of the application-- our understanding of baseball--tells us that home runs cause bases on balls and not the other way around, we can still check if, after stratifying by base on balls, we still see a home run effect or if it goes down.  We use the same code that we just used for bases on balls.  But now, we swap home runs for bases on balls to get this plot.  In this case, the slopes are the following.  You can see they are all around 1.5, 1.6, 1.7.  So they do not change that much from the original slope estimate, which was 1.84.  

[][**Regardless, it seems that if we stratify by home runs, we have an approximately bivariate normal distribution for runs versus bases on balls.  Similarly, if we stratify by bases on balls, we have an approximately normal bivariate distribution for runs versus home runs.  So what do we do?**]  It is somewhat complex to be computing regression lines for each strata.  We're essentially fitting this model that you can see in this equation with the slopes for x1 changing for different values of x2 and vice versa.  Here, x1 is bases on balls.  And x2 are home runs.  Is there an easier approach?  (**So we have to take whole influence aerospace into a equation???**)

[][*Note that if we take random variability into account, the estimated slopes by strata don't appear to change that much*] (`  Sorry what ???  `).  **If these slopes are in fact the same, this implies that this function beta 1 of x2 and the other function beta 2 of x1 are actually constant**.  Which, in turn, implies that the expectation of runs condition on home runs and bases on balls can be written in this simpler model.  This model implies that if the number of home runs is fixed, we observe a linear relationship between runs and bases on balls.  And that the slope of that relationship does not depend on the number of home runs.  Only the slope changes as the home runs increase. (`  Someone asked a question here  `)  [][*The statement "Only the slope changes as the home runs increase" is actually incorrect. We have since modified the script and re-filmed the video, though editing for the updated video has not been completed yet. The correct, updated text will be "Only the INTERCEPT changes". I will add a comment on the video page now until the updated video is uploaded.*]  Thingking and asking and answering.  

[][**The same is true if we swap home runs and bases on balls.  In this analysis, referred to as multivariate regression, we say that the bases on balls slope beta 1 is adjusted for the home run effect.  If this model is correct, then confounding has been accounted for.  But how do we estimate beta 1 and beta 2 from the data?  For this, we'll learn about linear models and least squares estimates.**]

[][Key points]

        A first approach to check confounding is to keep HRs fixed at a certain value and then examine the relationship between BB and runs.
        The slopes of BB after stratifying on HR are reduced, but they are not 0, which indicates that BB are helpful for producing runs, just not as much as previously thought.
        NOTE: There is an error in the script. The quote "Only the slope changes as the home runs increase." will be corrected to "Only the INTERCEPT changes as the home runs increase." in a future version of the video.

# Linear Models


Since Galton's original development, **regression has become one of the most widely used tools in data science**.  One reason for this has to do with the fact that [][*regression permits us to find relationships between two variables while adjusting for others*], as we have just shown for bases on balls and home runs.  This has been particularly popular in fields where **randomized experiments are hard to run** (`  Think, other cases ?  can we apply it into analyzing app users ???  `), such as economics and epidemiology.  **When we're not able to randomly assign each individual to a treatment or control group, confounding is particularly prevalent**.  

For example, consider estimating the effect of any fast foods on life expectancy using data collected from a random sample of people in some jurisdiction.  **Fast food consumers are more likely to be smokers, drinkers, and have lower incomes** (`  Your customer groups are already limited into certain group  `).  Therefore, a naive regression model may lead to an overestimate of a negative health effect of fast foods.  So how do we adjust for confounding in practice?  We can use regression.  [][*We have described how, if data is bivariate normal, then the conditional expectation follow a regression line*], that the conditional expectation as a line is not an extra assumption, but rather a result derived from the assumption, that they are approximately bivariate normal.  

[][*However, in practice it is common to explicitly write down a model that describes the relationship between two or more variables using what is called a linear model*].  We know that linear here does not refer to lines exclusively, but rather to the fact that the conditional expectation is a linear combination of known quantities.  Any combination that multiplies them by a constant and then adds them up with, perhaps, a shift.  For example, 2 plus 3x minus 4y plus 5z is a linear combination of x, y, and z.  So beta 0 plus beta 1x1, plus beta 2x 2 is a linear combination of x1 and x2.  The simplest linear model is a constant beta 0.  The second simplest is a line, beta 0 plus beta 1x.  

For Galton's data, we would denote n observed fathers' heights with x1 through xn.  Then we model n son heights we are trying to predict with the following model.  Here, the little xi's are the father's heights, which are fixed not random, due to the conditioning.  We've conditioned on these values.  And then Yi big Yi is the random son's height that we want to predict.  We further assume that the errors that are denoted with the Greek letter for E, epsilon, epsilon i, are independent from each other, have expected value 0, and the standard deviation, which is usually called sigma, does not depend on i.  It's the same for every individual.  We know the xi, but [][*to have a useful model for prediction, we need beta 0 and beta 1.  We estimate these from the data*].  Once we do, we can predict the sons' heights from any father's height, x.  **Note that if we further assume that the epsilons are normally distributed, then this model is exactly the same one we derived earlier for the bivariate normal distribution**.  A somewhat nuanced difference is that in the first approach, we assumed the data was a bivariate normal, and [][*the linear model was derived, not assumed*].  

**In practice, linear models are just assumed without necessarily assuming normality**.  The distribution of the epsilons is not specified.  But nevertheless, if your data is bivariate normal, the linear model that we just showed holds.  If your data is not bivariate normal, then you will need to have other ways of justifying the model ([][*Here, what is the other way to justifying the models ???*]).  One reason linear models are popular is that they are interpretable.  In the case of Galton's data, we can interpret the data like this.  **Due to inherited genes, the son's height prediction grows by beta 1 for each inch we increase the father's height x.  Because not all sons with fathers of height x are of equal height, we need the term epsilon, which explains the remaining variability.  This remaining variability includes the mother's genetic effect, environmental factors, and other biological randomness**.  

Note that given how we wrote the model, the intercept beta 0 is not very interpretable, as it is the predicted height of a son with a father with no height.  Due to regression to the mean, the prediction will usually be a bit larger than 0, which is really not very interpretable.  To make the intercept parameter more interpretable, we can rewrite the model slightly in the following way.  Here, we have changed xi to xi minus the average height x bar.  We have centered our covariate xi.  In this case, beta 0, the intercept, would be the predicted height for the average father for the case where xi equals x bar.  


**quotation form the book:**
**Note that if we further assume that the ε is normally distributed, then this model is exactly the same one we derived earlier by assuming bivariate normal data. A somewhat nuanced difference is that in the first approach we assumed the data was bivariate normal and that the linear model was derived, not assumed. In practice, linear models are just assumed without necessarily assuming normality: the distribution of the εs is not specified. Nevertheless, if your data is bivariate normal, the above linear model holds. If your data is not bivariate normal, then you will need to have other ways of justifying the model.**

# Assessment: Introduction to Linear Models


#  Question 1
1/1 point (graded)
As described in the videos, when we stratified our regression lines for runs per game vs. bases on balls by the number of home runs, what happened?
The slope of runs per game vs. bases on balls within each stratum was reduced because we removed confounding by home runs.
**The slope of runs per game vs. bases on balls within each stratum was reduced because there were fewer data points.**
The slope of runs per game vs. bases on balls within each stratum increased after we removed confounding by home runs.
The slope of runs per game vs. bases on balls within each stratum stayed about the same as the original slope.
correct
Answer
Correct: Correct.


#  Question 2
1/1 point (graded)

We run a linear model for sons’ heights vs. fathers’ heights using the Galton height data, and get the following results:

       > lm(son ~ father, data = galton_heights)

Call:
lm(formula = son ~ father, data = galton_heights)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)    father  
    35.71       0.50  
    

Interpret the numeric coefficient for "father."
For every inch we increase the son’s height, the predicted father’s height increases by 0.5 inches.
**For every inch we increase the father’s height, the predicted son’s height grows by 0.5 inches.**
For every inch we increase the father’s height, the predicted son’s height is 0.5 times greater.
correct

Explanation

The coefficient for “father” gives the predicted increase in son’s height for each increase of 1 unit in the father’s height. In this case, it means that for every inch we increase the father’s height, the son’s predicted height increases by 0.5 inches.


#  Question 3
1/1 point (graded)

We want the intercept term for our model to be more interpretable, so we run the same model as before but now we subtract the mean of fathers’ heights from each individual father’s height to create a new variable centered at zero.

      galton_heights <- galton_heights %>%
    mutate(father_centered=father - mean(father))
    

We run a linear model using this centered fathers’ height variable.

      > lm(son ~ father_centered, data = galton_heights)

Call:
lm(formula = son ~ father_centered, data = galton_heights)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)    father_centered  
    70.45          0.50  
    

Interpret the numeric coefficient for the intercept.
**The height of a son of a father of average height is 70.45 inches.**
The height of a son when a father’s height is zero is 70.45 inches.
The height of an average father is 70.45 inches.
correct

Explanation

Because the fathers’ heights (the independent variable) have been centered on their mean, the intercept represents the height of the son of a father of average height. In this case, that means that the height of a son of a father of average height is 70.45 inches.

If we had not centered fathers’ heights to its mean, then the intercept would represent the height of a son when a father’s height is zero.


#  Question 4
1/1 point (graded)

Suppose we fit a multivariable regression model for expected runs based on BB and HR:

E[R|BB = x_1, HR = x_2] = Beta_0 + Beta_1 * x_1 + Beta_2 * x_2
![](C:/Users/JJ/Pictures/equation question 4.png)

Suppose we fix
. Then we observe a linear relationship between runs and HR with intercept of:

Beta_0
Beta_0 + Beta_2 * x_2
**Beta_0 + Beta_1 * x_1**
Beta_0 + Beta_2 * x_1

lm(formula = son ~ father, data = galton_heights)
```

Summary: R linear regression uses the lm() function to create a regression model given some formula, in the form of Y~X+X2. To look at the model, you use the summary() function.


```{r}

galton_heights <- galton_heights %>%
  mutate(father_centered = father - mean(father))

lm(son ~ father_centered, data = galton_heights)

# So intercept changed, a lot, does that mean the median father and mean son are not match? 
# Or someone is not normal distributed ???

# Least Squares Estimates (LSE)


For linear models to be useful, **we have to estimate the unknown parameters, the betas**.  The standard approach in science is to find the values that minimize the distance of the fitted model to the data.  To quantify, this we use the [][**least squares equation**].  For Galton's data, we would write something like this.  This quantity is called the [][**Residual Sum of Squares, RSS**].  Once we find the values that minimize the RSS, **we call the values the Least Squares Estimate, LSE, and denote them, in this case, with beta 0 hat and beta 1 hat**.  

[][**Let's write the function that computes the RSS for any pair of values, beta 0 and beta 1, for our heights data.  It would look like this.  So for any pair of values, we get an RSS.  So this is a three-dimensional plot with beta 1 and beta 2, and x and y and the RSS as a z.  To find the minimum, you would have to look at this three-dimensional plot**].  Here, we're just going to make a two-dimensional version by keeping beta 0 fixed at 25.  So it will be a function of the RSS as a function of beta 1.  We can use this code to produce this plot.  We can see a clear minimum for beta 1 at around 0.65.  So you could see how we would pick the least squares estimates.  However, this minimum is for beta 1 when beta 0 is fixed at 25.  But we don't know if that's the minimum for beta 0.  We don't know if 25 comma 0.65 minimizes the equation across all pairs.  

[][****We could use trial and error, but it's really not going to work here (` Why and How `).  Instead we will use calculus.****]  We'll take the ***partial derivatives***, set them equal to 0, and solve for beta 1 and beta 0.  Of course, if we have many parameters, these equations can get rather complex.  But there are functions in R that do these calculations for us.  We will learn these soon.  To learn the mathematics behind this, you can consult the book on linear models.  


**quotation form the book:**
**In mathematics, when we multiply each variable by a constant and then add them together, we say we formed a linear combination of the variables.   For example, 3x−4y+5z is a linear combination of x, y, and z. We can also add a constant so 2+3x−4y+5z is also linear combination of x, y, and z.**

        For regression, we aim to find the coefficient values that minimize the distance of the fitted model to the data.
        Residual sum of squares (RSS) measures the distance between the true value and the predicted value given by the regression line. The values that minimize the RSS are called the least squares estimates (LSE).
        We can use partial derivatives to get the values for and in Galton's data.

# The lm Function


[][**In r, we can obtain the least squares estimates using the lm function**].  To fit the following model where Yi is the son's height and Xi is the father height, we would write the following piece of code.  This gives us the least squares estimates, which we can see in the output of r.  The general way we use lm is by using the **tilde (~)** character to let lm know which is the value we're predicting that's on the left side of the tilde, and which variables we're using to predict--those will be on the right side of the tilde.  The intercept is added automatically to the model.  So you don't have to include it when you write it.  

The object fit that we just computed includes more information about the least squares fit.  We can use the function summary to extract more of this information, like this.  **To understand some of the information included in this summary, we need to remember that the LSE are random variables.**  Mathematical statistics gives us some ideas of the distribution of these random variables.  And we'll learn some of that next.  End of transcript. Skip to the start.

# LSE are Random Variables


[][*The LSE are derived from the data, Y1 through Yn, which are random.  This implies that our estimates are random variables*].  **To see this, we can run a Monte Carlo simulation** in which we assume that the son and father height data that we have defines an entire population.  And we're going to take random samples of size 50 and compute the regression slope coefficient for each one.  We write this code, which gives us several estimates of the regression slope.  *We can see the variability of the estimates by plotting their distribution*.  Here you can see the histograms of the estimated beta 0's and the estimated beta 1's.  [][The reason these look normal is because the central limit theorem applies here as well.  For large enough N, the least squares estimates will be approximately normal with expected value beta 0 and beta 1 respectively].  

The standard errors are a bit complicated to compute, but mathematical theory does allow us to compute them, and they are included in the summary provided by the lm function.  Here are the estimated standard errors for one of our simulated data sets.  You could see them at the *second column in the coefficients table*.  [][*You can see that the standard errors estimates reported by the summary function are close to the standard errors that we obtain from our Monte Carlo simulation*].  

The summary function also reports t-statistics--this is the t value column--and p-value.  This is the Pr bigger than absolute value of t column.  [][***The t-statistic***] is not actually based on the central limit theorem, but rather on the assumption that [][the epsilons follow a normal distribution].  Under this assumption, mathematical theory tells us that the **LSE divided by their standard error, which we can see here and here, follow a t distribution with N minus p degrees of freedom, with p the number of parameters in our model, which in this case is 2**.  

The 2p values are testing the null hypothesis that beta 0 is 0 and beta 1 is 0 respectively.  

[Go read this book][**https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/null-hypothesis/]

[][***Note that as we described previously, for large enough N, the central limit works, and the t distribution becomes almost the same as a normal distribution.  So if either you assume the errors are normal and use the t distribution or if you assume that N is large enough to use the central limit theorem, you can construct confidence intervals for your parameters.***] (*`  How to construct confidnece intervals for our parameters  `*)  

We know here that although we will not show examples in this video, **hypothesis testing for regression models is very commonly used** in, for example, epidemiology and economics, **to make statements such as the effect of A and B was statistically significant after adjusting for X, Y, and Z**.  But it's very important to note that several assumptions--we just described some of them--have to hold for these statements to hold.

        Because they are derived from the samples, LSE are random variables.
        Beat_0 and Beta_1 appear to be normally distributed because the central limit theorem plays a role.

# Advanced Note on LSE


Although interpretation is not straight-forward, it is also useful to know that the LSE can be strongly correlated, which can be seen using this code:

lse %>% summarize(cor(beta_0, beta_1))

However, the correlation depends on how the predictors are defined or transformed.

Here we standardize the father heights, which changes x_i to x_i - x hat

.

B <- 1000
N <- 50
lse <- replicate(B, {
      sample_n(galton_heights, N, replace = TRUE) %>%
      mutate(father = father - mean(father)) %>%
      lm(son ~ father, data = .) %>% .$coef 
})

Observe what happens to the correlation in this case:

cor(lse[1,], lse[2,]) 



```{r}

# Predicted Variables are Random Variables


**Once we fit our model, we can obtain predictions of y by plugging the estimates (`the Beta0 and Beta1 and etc.`) into the regression model**.  For example, if the father's height is x, then our prediction for y--which we'll denote with a hat on top of the y--for the son's height will be the following.  We're just plugging in beta--the estimated betas into the equation.  If we plot y hat versus x, we'll see the regression line.  

[][*Note that the prediction y hat is also a random variable, and mathematical theory tells us what the standard errors are*].  If we *assume* the errors are normal or have a large enough sample size to use the Central Limit Theorem, ***we can construct confidence intervals for our predictions***, as well.  In fact, the ggplot layer geom underscore smooth, when we set method equals to lm--we've previously shown this for several plots--plots confidence intervals around the predicted y hat.  Let's look at an example with this code.  You can see the regression line.  Those are the predictions, and you see a band around them.  Those are the confidence intervals.  

[][*The R function predict() takes an lm object as input and returns these predictions*].  We can see it here in this code which produces this plot, and if requested the standard errors and other information from which we can construct confidence intervals can be obtained from the predict function.  You can see it by running this code.

The following code was used in the video to plot RSS with Beta_0 = 25.

```{r}
beta1 = seq(0, 1, len=nrow(galton_heights))

results <- data.frame(beta1 = beta1,
                      rss = sapply(beta1, rss, beta0 = 25))

  ggplot(aes(beta1, rss)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  geom_line(aes(beta1, rss), col=2)
```

In a model for sons’ heights vs fathers’ heights, what is the least squares estimate (LSE) for Beta_1 if we assume Beta_0 hat is 36?

Hint: modify the code above to do your analysis.
0.65
**0.5**
0.2
12
correct
Answer
Correct: Correct. You can tell from a plot of RSS vs that the minimum estimate is 0.5

*Explanation*

Using the code from the video, you can plot RSS vs to find the value for that minimizes the RSS. In this case, that value is 0.5 when we assume that

is 36.

When we assumed that
was 25, as in the sample code, the LSE for was 0.65.

# Question 4
0.5/1 point (graded)

We run a Monte Carlo simulation where we repeatedly take samples of N = 100 from the Galton heights data and compute the regression slope coefficients for each sample:


```{r}
B <- 1000
N <- 100

lse <- replicate(B, {
  sample_n(galton_heights, N, replace = TRUE) %>%
    lm(son ~ father, data = .) %>% 
    .$coef 
})


lse <- data.frame(beta_0 = lse[1,], beta_1 = lse[2,]) 

```
   
    
What does the central limit theorem tell us about the variables beta_0 and beta_1?

Select ALL that apply.
**They are approximately normally distributed.**
correct
The expected value of each is the true value of Beta_0 and Beta_1 (assuming the Galton heights data is a complete population).  ***Should think about this one*
correct
**The central limit theorem does not apply in this situation.**   [][Wrong Choice, restructure your mind]
It allows us to test the hypothesis that Beta_0 = 0 and Beta_1 = 0 .
partially correct
Answer
Incorrect:
Correct. With a large enough N (*`  So how much fit this large enough ?  Or should I plot the histogram every time to see if its a bell curve  `*), the distributions of both beta_0 and beta_1 are approximately normal.
Try again. For large enough N, the central limit theorem does apply.

Explanation
# ================================================================================================================================
With a large enough N, the central limit theorem applies and tells us that the distributions of both beta_0 and beta_1 are approximately normal. [][*The expected (` Expected `) values of beta_0 and beta_1 are the true values of Beta_0 and Beta_1, assuming that the Galton heights data are a complete population.*]

For hypothesis testing, we assume that the errors in the model are normally distributed.

# =============================================================================================================================
Answer
Correct:
Correct. This is one way to plot predictions and confidence intervals for a linear model of sons’ heights vs. fathers’ heights. This is one of two correct answers.
Correct. This code uses the predict command to generate predictions and 95% confidence intervals for the linear model of sons’ heights vs. fathers’ heights. This is one of two correct answers.

[][*Explanation*]

If using the geom_smooth command, you need to specify that method = “lm” in your geom_smooth command, otherwise the smooth line is a loess smooth and not a linear model.

If using the predict command, you need to include the confidence intervals on your figure by first specifying that you want confidence intervals in the predict command, and then adding them to your figure as a geom_ribbon.

We have shown how BB and singles have similar predictive power for scoring runs. Another way to compare the usefulness of these baseball metrics is by assessing how stable they are across the years. Because we have to pick players based on their previous performances, we will prefer metrics that are more stable. In these exercises, we will compare the stability of singles and BBs.

Before we get started, we want to generate two tables: one for 2002 and another for the average of 1999-2001 seasons. We want to define per plate appearance statistics, keeping only players with more than 100 plate appearances. Here is how we create the 2002 table:
```
library(Lahman)
bat_02 <- Batting %>% filter(yearID == 2002) %>%
  mutate(pa = AB + BB, singles = (H - X2B - X3B - HR)/pa, bb = BB/pa) %>%
  filter(pa >= 100) %>%
  select(playerID, singles, bb)
```


# Question 9

2.0/2.0 points (graded)

Now compute a similar table but with rates computed over 1999-2001. Keep only rows from 1999-2001 where players have 100 or more plate appearances, calculate each player's single rate and BB rate per stint (where each row is one stint - a player can have multiple stints within a season), then calculate the average single rate (mean_singles) and average BB rate (mean_bb) per player over the three year period.
How many players had a single rate mean_singles of greater than 0.2 per plate appearance over 1999-2001?

## Course  /  Section 2: Linear Models  /  2.3: Tibbles, do, and broom


# Advanced dplyr: Tibbles


Let's go back to baseball.  In a previous example, we estimated the regression lines to predict runs from bases and balls in different home run strata.  We first constructed a data frame similar to this.  Then, to compute the regression line in each strata, since we didn't know the lm function back then, we used the formula directly like this.  *We argued that the slopes are similar and that the differences were perhaps due to random variation*.  To provide a more rigorous defense of the slopes being the same, which is what led to our multivariate regression model, [][*we could compute confidence intervals for each slope*].  We have not learned the formula for this, but the lm function provides enough information to construct them.  

First, note that if we try to use the lm function to get the estimated slope like this, we don't get what we want.  The lm function ignored the group_by.  This is expected, because lm is not part of the tidyverse and does not know how to handle the outcome of group_by which is a group tibble.  ([][*` See the outcome list we receive by summarize() function and the .$coef after the lm ?? `*]) 
We're going to describe tibbles in some details now.  When summarize receives the output of group_by, it somehow knows which rows of the table go with which groups.  But where is this information stored in the data frame?  Let's write some code to see the output of a group_by call.  Note that there are no columns with the information needed to define the groups.  But if you look closely at the output, you notice the line "A tibble, 6 by 3."  We can learn the class of the return object using this line of code, and we see that the class is a "tbl."  This is pronounced "tibble."  It is also a tbl_df.  This is equivalent to tibble.  **The tibble is a special kind of data frame** (what makes it special ??).  We have seen them before, because [][*tidyverse functions such as group_by and also summarize always return this type of data frame*].  The **group_by function returns a special kind of tibble, the grouped tibble**.  We will say more about the grouped tibbles later.  Note that the manipulation verbs, [][*select, filter, mutate, and arrange, don't necessarily return tibbles.  They preserve the class of the input*].  If they receive a regular data frame, they return a regular data frame.  If they receive a tibble, they return a tibble.  But []***tibbles are the default data frame for the tidyverse***].  Tibbles are very similar to data frames.  You can think of them as modern versions of data frames.  Next, we're going to describe briefly three important differences.

# Tibbles: Differences from Data Frames


In this video, we're going to describe some of the [][*main differences between tibbles and data frames*].  First, the print method for tibble is much more readable than that of a data frame.  To see this, type teams on your console after loading the Baseball Lahman Database.  And you will see a very, very long list of columns and rows.  It's barely readable.  Teams is a data frame with many rows and columns.  That's why you see that.  Nevertheless, the output just shows everything wraps around and is hard to read.  It is so bad that we don't even print it here.  We'll let you print it on your own screen.  Now if you convert this data frame to a tibble data frame, the output is much more readable.  Here's an example.  That's the first main difference between tibbles and data frames.  

A second one is that if you subset the columns of a data frame, you may get back an object that is not a data frame.  With tibbles, this is not the case.  Here's an example.  If we subset a tibble, we get back a tibble.  **This is useful in the tidyverse since functions require data frames as input**.  Now whenever you want to access the original vector that defines a column in a table, for this, you actually have to use the accessor dollar sign.  A related feature to this is that tibbles will give you a warning if you try to access a column that does not exist.  That's not the case for data frames.  For example, if we accidentally write hr in lowercase instead of uppercase, with a data frame, all we get is a no.  No warning.  This can make it quite hard to debug code.  In contrast, if it's a tibble, and you try to access the lowercase hr column, which doesn't exist, you actually get a warning.  

A third difference is that while columns of a data frame need to be a vector of number, strings or Boolean, tibbles can have more complex objects, such as lists or functions.  Also note that we can create tibbles with the tibble function.  So, look at this line of code.  We're creating a column that actually has functions in it.  You can see the output here.  

Finally, the last difference we describe is that tibbles can be grouped.  The function group by returns a special kind of tibble, a grouped tibble.  This class stores information that lets you know which rows are in which groups.  The tidyverse functions, in particular [][*the summarize functions, are aware of the group information*].  In the example we showed, we saw that the lm function, which is not part of the tidyverse, does not know how to deal with group tibbles.  The object is basically converted to a regular data frame, and then the function runs ignoring the groups.  This is why we only get one pair of estimates, as we see here.  To make these non-tidyverse function better integrate with a tidyverse, we will learn a new function, the function do.  


[][Key points]
Tibbles are more readable than data frames.
If you subset a data frame, you may not get a data frame. If you subset a tibble, you always get a tibble.
Tibbles can hold more complex objects such as lists or functions.
Tibbles can be grouped.

# do


In this video, we'll describe the very useful do( ) function.  The tidyverse functions know how to interpret group tibbles.  Furthermore, to facilitate stringing commands through the pipe, tidyverse function consistently return data frames.  Since this assures that the output of 1 is accepted as the input of another.  ***But most our functions do not recognize group tibbles, nor do they return data frames***.  [][**The lm( ) function is an example.**]  

The do( ) function serves as a bridge between our functions, such as lm( ) and the tidyverse.  **The do( ) function understands group tibbles and always returns a data frame**.  So let's try to use the do( ) function to fit a regression line to each home run strata.  We would do it like this.  Notice that [][*we did in fact fit a regression line to each strata*] (*when would we not ?*).  But the do( ) function would create a data frame with the first column being the strata value.  And a column named fit.  We chose that name.  It could be any name.  And that column will contain the result of the lm( ) call.  Therefore, the return tibbles has a column with lm( ) objects in the cells, which is not very useful.  Also note that if we do not name a column, then do( ) will return the actual output of lm( ), not a data frame.(*understand how R doing its job*)  And this will result in an error since do( ) is expecting a data frame as output.  

If you write this, you will get the following error.  [][*For a useful data frame to be constructed, the output of the function, inside do( ), must be a data frame as well*]. (But we did stored lm object in one column before, using a variable)  ***We could build a function that returns only what you want in the form of a data frame***. (that is if you know the data structure of outcome object well)  We could write for example, this function.  And then we use to do( ) without naming the output, since we are already getting a data frame.  We can write this very simple piece of code and now we get the expected result.  We get the slope for each strata and the standard error for that slope.  If we name the output, then we get a column containing the data frame.  So if we write this piece of code, now once again, we get one of these complex tibbles with a column having a data frame in each cell.  Which is again, not very useful.  

All right.  Now we're going to cover one last feature of do( ).  If the data frame being returned has more than one row, these will be concatenated appropriately.  Here's **an example in which return both estimated parameters of each strata and their value and error**.  The slope and intercept.  We write this piece of code.  And now we use the do( ) function as we used it before, and get a very useful tibble, giving us the estimates of the slope and intercept, as well as the standard errors.  Now, if you think this is all a bit too complicated, you're not alone.  To simplify things, we're going to introduce the broom package, which was designed to facilitate the use of model fitting functions such as lm( ) with the tidyverse.

# broom


The original task we ask for in a previous video was to *provide an estimate and a confidence interval for the slope estimates of each strata* ( Do you remember how this question was raised?? ).  The broom package will make this quite easy.  [][*Broom has three main functions all of which extract information from the object returned by the function lm(), and return it in a tidy verse friendly data frame*].  These functions are **tidy, glance and augment**.  The tidy function returns estimates and related information as a data frame.  Here's an example.  We can add other important summaries, such as confidence intervals, using arguments like this.  Because the outcome is a data frame, we can immediately use it with do() function to string together the commands that produce the table we are after.  So this piece of code will generate what we wanted to see.  

Because a data frame is returned, we can filter and select the rows and columns we want.  So this simple piece of code gives us exactly the table we asked for.  We have filtered away the intercept rows, and only show the columns we care about, the estimate and the confidence intervals. Furthermore, [][*a table like this makes visualization with ggplot quite easy*].  So this piece of code produces this nice plot, which provides very useful information.  Now we return to discussing our original task of determining if slopes change.  The plot we just made using do and broom shows that the confidence intervals overlap, which provides a nice visual confirmation that our assumption that the slopes do not change with home run strata, is relatively safe.  Earlier we mentioned two other functions from the broom package, glance and augment. Glance and augment relate to model specific and observation specific outcomes, respectively.  Here we can see the model fit summary the glance returns.  You can learn more about these summaries in any regression textbook.  We'll see an example of augment in a future video.

# Question 1
1/1 point (graded)

As seen in the videos, what problem do we encounter when we try to run a linear model on our baseball data, grouping by home runs?

There is not enough data in some levels to run the model.
**The lm() function does not know how to handle grouped tibbles.**   [][*The key is to read, to think, thus proving answer here is bad*]
The results of the lm() function cannot be put into a tidy format.
correct
Explanation

The lm() function does not know how to handle grouped tibbles, so we can't simply run a linear model on the baseball data grouped by home runs. We need something to bridge between the grouped tibble and the lm() function.

# Question 5
1/1 point (graded)
You want to take the tibble dat, which we used in the video on the do() function, and run the linear model R ~ BB for each strata of HR. Then you want to add three new columns to your grouped tibble: the coefficient, standard error, and p-value for the BB term in the model.

You’ve already written the function get_slope(), shown below.

```{r}
dat <- Teams %>% filter(yearID %in% 1961:2001) %>%
  mutate(HR = round(HR/G, 1), 
         BB = BB / G,
         R = R / G) %>%
  select(HR, BB, R) %>%      # Why doing select() here? 
  filter(HR >= 0.4 & HR <=1.2)


get_slope <- function(data) {
  fit <- lm(R ~ BB, data = data)
  sum.fit <- summary(fit)
  
  data.frame(slope = sum.fit$coefficients[2, "Estimate"], 
             se = sum.fit$coefficients[2, "Std. Error"],
             pvalue = sum.fit$coefficients[2, "Pr(>|t|)"])
}

```

    
What additional code could you write to accomplish your goal?

```
dat %>% 
  group_by(HR) %>% 
  do(get_slope)
        

dat %>% 
  group_by(HR) %>% 
  do(get_slope(.))
        

dat %>% 
  group_by(HR) %>% 
  do(slope = get_slope(.))
        

dat %>% 
  do(get_slope(.))

```

correct
Answer
Correct:Correct. This will create a tibble with four columns: HR, slope, se, and pvalue for each level of HR.
Explanation

```{r}
dat %>% 
  group_by(HR) %>% 
  do(get_slope(.))
```
        
This is the only command that correctly creates a tibble with four columns: HR, slope, se, and pvalue for each level of HR. The data frame must be passed to get_slope() using .. If you name the results of the do() command such as in the code do(slope = get_slope(.)), that will save all results in a single column called slope. If you forget group_by(), then the results will be a model on the data as a whole, rather than on the data stratified by home runs.

# Question 6
1/1 point (graded)
The output of a broom function is always what?

A data.frame
A list
A vector
correct
Explanation

The broom functions always output data.frame.


# Question 7
1/1 point (graded)
You want to know whether the relationship between home runs and runs per game varies by baseball league. You create the following dataset:

```{r}
dat <- Teams %>% filter(yearID %in% 1961:2001) %>%
  mutate(HR = HR/G,
         R = R/G) %>%
  select(lgID, HR, BB, R) 

```

    
What code would help you quickly answer this question?

```{r}
dat %>% 
  group_by(lgID) %>% 
  do(tidy(lm(R ~ HR, data = .), conf.int = T)) %>% 
  filter(term == "HR") 
        

dat %>% 
  group_by(lgID) %>% 
  do(glance(lm(R ~ HR, data = .)))
        

dat %>% 
  do(tidy(lm(R ~ HR, data = .), conf.int = T)) %>% 
  filter(term == "HR")
        

dat %>% 
  group_by(lgID) %>% 
  do(mod = lm(R ~ HR, data = .))

```

correct
Answer
Correct:Correct. This is a good application of the command tidy(), from the broom package.
Explanation

```
dat %>% 
  group_by(lgID) %>% 
  do(tidy(lm(R ~ HR, data = .), conf.int = T)) %>% 
  filter(term == "HR")
```

This code is a good application of the command tidy(), from the broom package.

The glance() function provides data on model fit rather than on effect estimates and confidence intervals. If you forget the line group_by(lgID), your code will give you a single estimate for the entire dataset because you have not grouped the data by league ID.

```
dat %>% 
  group_by(lgID) %>% 
  do(mod = lm(R ~ HR, data = .))
```

This code gives get a data.frame with the column mod, which contains the linear model results. While it is possible to then extract effect estimates and confidence intervals from this model, it is not nearly as easy as using the tidy function.

# Below are my code during testing
```{r}

  filter(HR >= 0.4 & HR <=1.2)


get_slope <- function(data) {
  fit <- lm(R ~ BB, data = data)
  sum.fit <- summary(fit)
